# learn_python


The aim of this repository is to share my knowledge about python with the community. 

There is a tutorial under /learning\ python folder for those who wants to learn python FAST( given that you know coding in some other programming language).

I have used Jupyter notebook as my editor and compiler. It is an interactive browser IDE where you can have markdown and code parallel in one file. 

Steps to run this repo:

1) Download Jupyter notebook. https://jupyter.org/install
2) clone the repo
3) In your kernal: cd to the local clone and type jupyter notebook
4) That's it.
